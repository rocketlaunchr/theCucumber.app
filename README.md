# The Problem
## (It's actually an epidemic!)

When you are using your computer **6–12 hours per day, 5½ days per week**, your eye muscles get strained due to focussing on short distances. Couple that with a powerful backlight beaming at your eyes, and reduced blink rates of up to **68–80%**, and you can see why your eyes suffer.

The unnatural sedentary position puts enormous stress on your **lower back and neck**. Over time, as you age, **chronic back pain** could emerge.

Studies have shown that most employees don't skip work when they have eye strain. Instead, they operate at reduced productivity levels. In 2011, the loss was estimated at **$799 USD per employee** in Japan.

# The Solution
## What does the app do?

The **only solution** to digital eye strain and back pain is to take regular **short** breaks. The problem is when you're working hard, it's tough to take a break.

**theCucumber.app** covers your entire screen. It is a simple yet powerful break scheduler **designed** for teams (& individuals), so the whole team takes their break synchronized. This fosters team unity and eventually becomes engrained in the team culture.

It's available for **macOS** and **Windows 10**. Within a month, your team should notice **reduced eye strain, better back and neck health**, and in some fields, **improved concentration and creativity**.



# How does it work?

Managers set scheduled breaks for the entire team. No matter the timezone, breaks are scheduled in unison to generate team cohesion.

Optometrists advocate the **20–20–20 rule**. This means every **20 minutes**, take a **20–second** break by looking at something **6m** ( 20ft ) away. This will help relax your eye muscles from the stress and strain of looking at a closeup screen.

To counter the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, short breaks for stretching and walking are recommended.

All break schedules are extensively customizable so they can be set to operate during only office hours.

| **ROBUST SCREEN BLOCKING**<br/>When you're working hard, it's tough to take a break. Robust screen blocking covers your workspace to force you to take your scheduled breaks until it becomes habitual. The productivity gains will come in the long-run.   | **BLINK ALARM**<br/>Your blink rate reduces by 68–80% when you're in front of a screen. The increased dryness contributes to digital eye strain. You can set an alarm to remind you to blink at your natural frequency.     |

| **OFFLINE ENABLED**<br/>Eye strain can strike when you're not online. You could be working in an airplane or remotely in the middle of the Australian Outback. The scheduled breaks will continue to protect you.   | **PRESENTATION PAUSES**<br/>Sometimes you're in a video conference. Other times you've got an important presentation. You can pause the app up to the daily limit so it doesn't interfere with immediate priorities.     |

| **URGENT TASKS**<br/>The Screen Block is there to help you. On the rare occasion when you have an urgent task, you can skip the scheduled break — but only up to a daily limit.   | **SOPHISTICATED SCHEDULING**<br/>Managers can create fine-grained break schedules such as only during office hours. More advanced users can use CRON syntax to create breaks such as on a particular day of the week or range of months.     |
