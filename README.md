> Digital eye strain impacts 71% of employees. It's overlooked in the modern workplace. It costs productivity and employee happiness. **[Download here](https://github.com/rocketlaunchr/theCucumber.app/releases)**

⭐ **the project to show your appreciation.**

# The Problem
## (It's actually an epidemic!)

When you are using your computer **6–12 hours per day, 5½ days per week**, your eye muscles get strained due to focussing on short distances. Couple that with a powerful backlight beaming at your eyes, and reduced blink rates of up to **68–80%**, and you can see why your eyes suffer.

The unnatural sedentary position puts enormous stress on your **lower back and neck**. Over time, as you age, **chronic back pain** could emerge.

Studies have shown that most employees don't skip work when they have eye strain. Instead, they operate at reduced productivity levels. In 2011, the loss was estimated at **$799 USD per employee** in Japan.

# The Solution
## What does the app do?

The **only solution** to digital eye strain and back pain is to take regular **short** breaks. The problem is when you're working hard, it's tough to take a break.

**theCucumber.app** covers your entire screen. It is a simple yet powerful break scheduler **designed** for teams (& individuals), so the whole team takes their break synchronized. This fosters team unity and eventually becomes engrained in the team culture.

It's available for **macOS** and **Windows 10**. Within a month, your team should notice **reduced eye strain, better back and neck health**, and in some fields, **improved concentration and creativity**.



# How does it work?

Managers set scheduled breaks for the entire team. No matter the timezone, breaks are scheduled in unison to generate team cohesion.

Optometrists advocate the **20–20–20 rule**. This means every **20 minutes**, take a **20–second** break by looking at something **6m** ( 20ft ) away. This will help relax your eye muscles from the stress and strain of looking at a closeup screen.

To counter the effects of a sedentary lifestyle, short breaks for stretching and walking are recommended.

All break schedules are extensively customizable so they can be set to operate during only office hours.
